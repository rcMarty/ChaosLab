# IFS (Iterated Function Systems)

IFS are mathematical systems used to generate fractals using repeated affine transformations.
They are widely used for modeling natural phenomena like ferns, clouds, or coastlines.

## What it is

An IFS consists of a set of affine transformations, each applied repeatedly to a point in space.
Each transformation has a probability, and one is selected at random during each iteration.
Over time, this creates a self-similar, fractal structure.

## Components and Parameters

### Components for IFS

- **Affine transformation (A)** – a 2x2 matrix defining scale, rotation, and shear.
- **Translation vector (b)** – shifts the point in space.
- **Probability** – chance of selecting each transformation at each step.
- **Iterations** – number of times transformations are applied.

## Code Structure

In constructor, there is map of transformations and their probabilities for 3D space.
Also, there is function for choosing one of the maps.
It is a matter of course to have a function for generating points in 3D space and rendering them in animation and in static picture.

## Results

Example of Barnsley fern generated by a 4-rule IFS system:

You can observe the recursive nature of the pattern – parts resemble the whole.

## Insights

- Transformations must be carefully designed to produce appealing structures.
- More iterations yield sharper, more detailed fractals but require way more computation.
- Probabilities control the density of different areas of the shape.
- IFS offers a simple but powerful way to generate complex, natural-looking forms.
